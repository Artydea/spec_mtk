非常感谢强大的网友VMware Workstation unrecoverable error 解决了。
为了方便，虚拟机都是采用挂起状态，今天在启动虚拟机的时候出现如下提示错误：
VMware Workstation unrecoverable error: (vmx)
Exception 0xc0000006 (disk error while paging) has occurred.
A log file is available in "F:/vmware/RHEL5.4-RHCE-Server/vmware.log".  A core file is available in "F:/vmware/RHEL5.4-RHCE-Server/vmware-vmx-3148.dmp".  Please request support and include the contents of the log file and core file.  
To collect data to submit to VMware support, choose "Collect Support Data" from the Help menu.
You can also run the "vm-support" script in the Workstation folder directly.
We will respond on the basis of your support entitlement.

开始以为虚拟内存出现问题，重启机器问题依旧。

解决方法：删除或修改虚拟机目录下拓展名为.vmss文件，再次启动即可。
